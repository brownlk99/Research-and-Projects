#### Summary
###### There’s been a large amount of research pertaining to the number of words per minute one can understand. However, there appears to be a gap in connecting understanding to recall and even more important, performance. This concern grows ever more major as we move towards substantial integration with technology. Since we are constantly looking to be more efficient with our time, this paper explores whether there is a tradeoff between playback speed and ability to recall and utilize the incoming information. This tradeoff was explored by having subjects view three different videos of the same category at different speeds (1x, 1.5x, and 2x) and then testing them on the knowledge they learned. Although the results were somewhat inconclusive, words per minute had no correlation to the number of correct answers (up to 2x speed). In future studies, it’d be interesting to determine where this cutoff of comprehensible speech and ability to retain semantic information lies.
