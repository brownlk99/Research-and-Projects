#### Summary
###### The Capitol Building was stormed on January 6th in order to disrupt the certification process of the presidential election. Several called for the death of (at the time) Vice-President Mike Pence, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, as well as several other prominent politicians. No one is born radicalized, so how did this occur? How and why are people driven to this point of radicalized violence? I believe the COVID-19 pandemic made up a significant portion of the powder keg that erupted on January 6th. The implications of this are extremely important as they could predict and even give insights into how to prepare for or prevent future atrocities caused by extremist groups. In this study, I explore previous research on the topic of radicalization and ultimately develop an agent-based model depicting the process of how the pandemic has accelerated the rate of the movement toward extremist behavior.
