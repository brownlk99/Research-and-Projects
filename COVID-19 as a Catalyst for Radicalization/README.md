#### Summary
###### It has been well established that grievances and isolation play a major role in the process of radicalization. With that being said, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a major effect on both an individualâ€™s grievances as well as their isolation. This isolation plays a major role in the modern era with the ability to intentionally or unintentionally search for like-minded individuals. In this study, I explore previous research on the topic of radicalization and ultimately develop an agent-based model depicting the process of how the pandemic has accelerated the rate of the movement toward extremist behavior.
