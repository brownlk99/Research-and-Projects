#### Summary
###### Inspired by the overwhelming concern around the growing COVID-19 pandemic, I set out to model the spread of a virus throughout a population. Through this model, one is able to derive what possible preventive measures can be put in place in order to contain the spread. The multiple parameters of the simulated virus allow one to view how different viral characteristics directly affect the propagation. Hopefully with this knowledge we will be better suited to protect our loved ones and neighbors by taking the proper preventive measures in order to halt the spread.
