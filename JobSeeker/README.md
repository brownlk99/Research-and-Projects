# Hi and welcome to JobSeeker!

All of the necessary files to run the code will be in the src folder (Employer.java, Job.java, Seeker.java, and JobSeekerDriver.java)

We will be providing additional .txt and .ser files which are completely optional if you want to begin the search with some premade profiles.
If you choose to use the premade files (optional):
   1) You MUST copy the .ser into the project folder, you DO NOT NEED to copy any .txt's into the project folder (they are generated only to read)
   2) We will be providing a previousUsers.txt which contains the username and password of the user for you to be able to access
   3) You will still be able to make new accounts and modify them, you will just have some to start with
   4) The .txt's provided will be the username of the particular user with their specific details if you wish to check to see they are importing properly

Instructions:
   1) To run the program, all the user needs to do is compile and run!
   2) The files will be read in automatically
   3) When inputing a username, make sure NO SPACES are used as it uses .next() (it will only take whatever you type in before the space)
   4) It is important to always return to the MENU OF OPTIONS (for either the Seeker or Employer) and SIGN OUT to ensure that changes have been saved
   5) To terminate the program you can either terminate from the LOGIN MENU with the IDE's terminate button OR you can type "/terminate" into the USERNAME LOGIN MENU
   6) Most of the program IS CASE SENSITIVE, so please type in the what you are prompted with for proper results
   7) You will be prompted for everything that you need / should input

Without further ado, enjoy the hunt for the perfect job or employee!
